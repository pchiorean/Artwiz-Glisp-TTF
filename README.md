True Type version of the classic glisp pixel BDF font. Based on the original design of glisp by Artwiz (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artwiz_fonts) as repackaged by aleczapka (http://artwizaleczapka.sourceforge.net).

Expanded character set and kerning by me. Modified characters are depicted in blue, additions in green, romanian support in red.

Very old stuff, saved here just to keep it alive.
