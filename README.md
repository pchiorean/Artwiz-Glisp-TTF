True Type version of the cool Glisp pixel BDF font. Based on the original design of glisp by Artwiz (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artwiz_fonts) as repackaged by aleczapka (http://artwizaleczapka.sourceforge.net).

Expanded character set and kerning by me. Modified characters are depicted in blue, additions in green, romanian support in red.

## Drift

True Type version of Drift, a monospace pixel BDF font by Artwiz, recreated in True Type. Extended coverage (Latin-1 and some Latin-2). Adapted for iPhone's Mobile Terminal, perfectly usable on the desktop.

I used an old version of FontLab, run on Linux through Wine. 10 pixel grid (120 UPM); traced every glyph by hand with the rectangle tool.

Very old stuff, saved here just to keep it alive.
